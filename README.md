# Moonbot â€“ Landing Page

This is a clean, responsive landing page for **Moonbot**, a fictional high-performance Twitch chatbot.  
It was built as a **personal project to practice HTML and CSS concepts** learned in college and showcase front-end development skills.

The Moonbot brand identity, including the **logo** and **robot icon** were designed by me using **Canva**.
